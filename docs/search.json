    "section": "",
    "text": "To make a flavorful Chicken Biryani, start by marinating 1 kg of chicken pieces in a mixture of 1 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, 1 tablespoon red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1 tablespoon biryani masala, 1 teaspoon garam masala, salt, and lemon juice, along with chopped coriander and mint leaves. Let it marinate for at least an hour. While marinating, prepare 2 cups basmati rice by rinsing and soaking it, then partially cook it in boiling water with cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and salt. In a pan, heat oil or ghee, and cook sliced onions until golden brown, then add green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, and tomatoes until soft. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the oil separates. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken, sprinkle with biryani masala, and add more coriander and mint leaves. Drizzle with saffron milk if desired, cover tightly, and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes to blend the flavors. Gently mix before serving and garnish with fried onions if you like. Enjoy your aromatic and delicious Chicken Biryani!"
